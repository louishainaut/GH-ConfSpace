## Abstract


## Code

The files in this repository allow to do the following computations:
- SymGroup + GL decomposition: Computes lower bounds for the cohomology groups and provides helper functions to improve the readability of the results. Up to n=10 the code offers the possibility to correct the lower bounds in order to obtain the exact answer. For a higher number of particles it only corrects the multiplicity of the symmetric and exterior powers.
- Ranks-GL-Irrep-Multidim & Ranks-Equidim: Compute the multiplicities of representations of the general linear group.
- traces for gl: Implements the Fox-Neuwirth for computing the multiplicities of S_n representations. One can also use this code to compute the trace of certain diagonal endomorphisms of the free group. This file has a large overlap with the code used in [arXiv: 2109.03302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03302)
